Is-A relationshp:
------------------

if there is class Bike
if there is class Car
if there is class SportsBike

now here we can say that SportsBike is a bike  ---> Here we implement Inheritence between the classes

and we cannot say Car is a Bike  --> Here we cannot implement Inheritence


HAS - A Relationship: 
----------------------

if there is class Car
if there is class Engine
if there is class AudiCar

here we say that Car has a Engine --> this is HAS-A relationship -->inheritence not possible

we cannot say Car has AudiCar --> this is IS-A relationship
